# SDITAA
## Space Debris Internet and TLE Allocation Analysis
#####
This project has its main objective as to grabbing the latest space debris information from the 
internet including position, velocity, and other pivotal parameters to identify and characterize
the emanated space debris. This information is then allocated with the updated information stored 
as a TLE database and publicly released in the website [SPACE-TRACK.ORG](https://www.space-track.org/auth/login).
